# Test Programming Languages Syntax Highlight

This is a fork intended to test many programming languages syntax.  

## What???

Let me explain  

I was using `vim` and wondering how the programming language \<insert name here\> syntax will look like in vim's syntax hightlight theme.  
To answer that, I thought "hum, I need a complete syntax example of every language I am thinking" so this repo's fork was perfect to test.  

I just changed the file extensions (so the highlight can work) of the languages I want and/or know the ext, 
some aren't even languages so mardown will be the correct choice since it is just explanation.
